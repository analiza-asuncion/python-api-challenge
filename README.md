WEATHERPY

- Created a Python script recording dynamic weather data of 500 plus cities acrosss the world f varying distance from the equator using Citipy and OpenWeatherMap API.

- Task included creating 4 scatter plots:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

- Task included creating 8 linear regression plots:
 
Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

- print log while city weather data is being retrieved

- csv file with all of the retrieved weather data
- .pngs for each scatter plot 

VACATIONPY  
   
-Wrote Python script for  a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the WeatherPy homework.

- Created another heatmap using Google Places API which narrows down the Heatmap to find the ideal weather condition using the following conditions:

A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

Wind speed less than 10 mph.

Zero cloudiness.

Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.
